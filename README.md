## Description

This is a test application for verifying that the ESM build of the [DN Mithril](https://github.com/eyeyellow/dn_mithril) library works with build tools like webpack. I wanted to test if we could bundle and use native [ES6 modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) which require a server, as loading the html file locally causes CORS errors.

## To Serve
- Run the command `npm run serve` to serve the html and javascript bundle
